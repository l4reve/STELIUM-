## Features

## How to Play

1. **Objective**: The goal of Minesweeper is to uncover all the squares on the board that do not contain mines without triggering any mines.

2. **Gameplay**:
   - When prompted, enter the coordinates (x, y) to reveal the square at that position.
   - The coordinate system starts from (0, 0) in the top-left corner and increases horizontally to the right and vertically downwards.
   - If you uncover a square with a mine, you lose the game.
   - If you uncover a square without a mine, a number will be shown indicating how many adjacent squares contain mines.
   - Use this information to deduce which squares are safe to uncover.

3. **Winning**: You win the game when all non-mine squares are uncovered.

4. **Customization**:
   - You can customize the board size and number of mines in the settings.
